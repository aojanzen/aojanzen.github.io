Google Fu
=========
Google is a super helpful source of information for pentesters that makes a
successful pentester.

An overview of the syntax for Google's search engine can easily be found
`online <https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/>`_. Some of
these operators can be used to narrow down our search results and improve the
quality of our results a lot.

* ``site:tesla.com`` will limit the results to hits on the domains ending on
  ``tesla.com``
* Certain subdomains can be taken out of the search results with the ``-``
  operator, e.g. ``site:tesla.com -www``
* One can also search for specific filetypes, e.g. for pdf documents, with the
  ``filetype`` qualifier, e.g. ``site: tesla filetype:pdf``. It is sometimes
  possible to find documents (e.g. ``doc``, ``docx``, ``xlsx``, ``csv``, etc.)
  with highly sensitive information just by searching for these filetypes.

In addition to the hints in the video, I should familiarize myself with the
many details provided on the above-named website.
