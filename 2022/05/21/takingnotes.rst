Taking Notes
============

Use notekeeping tools to store key information (commands, screenshots)!

Information from different sources can be brought together in one notebook, but
several notebooks on different topics are also sensible to keep the complexity
under control.

Notekeeping tools can also be used to put information together
while conducting the pentest. Make sure to store IP address and date.
Checkmarks can be added when the finding has been included in the final report.

Use an image editor, e.g. to add a border, invert colors (especially when working
in dark mode!), obfuscate information, copy to clipboard and from there into
notekeeping tool.

For notekeeping: Windows: KeepNote (not updated for a while!), OneNote, Linux: Cherrytree
For screenshots: Windows: Greenshot, Linux: Flameshot

Pen and paper is also a possible alternative!
