Identifying Our Target
======================
To find a client that we can attack (legally) to practice reconnaissance, we
use the public bugbounty program `bugcrowd.com <https://www.bugcrowd.com/>`_.

.. more::

There are programs on their website that allow you to attack their websites or
part of their websites, report bugs to the website owner and receive a payment
as a reward.

TESLA was used as an example in "Practical Ethical Hacking", but one definitely
has to make sure that the program is still active before one starts any
hacktivity against some website. On the bugcrowd website, click on "Products"
to see all active bugbounty programs. TESLA can be found with the search bar on
top of the page.

One should read the "Rules of Engagement" thoroughly, especially the websites
that are out of scope.
