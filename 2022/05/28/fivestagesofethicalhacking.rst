The Five Stages of Ethical Hacking
==================================
The five stages of ethical hacking are the same, irrespective if you hack into
a network or a website:

.. more::

#. Reconnaissance / information gathering (active vs. passive [Google, LinkedIn])
#. Scanning & enumeration (using tools like Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, etc. to scan
   avtively against a client for open ports and vulnerabilities. Enumeration
   is the process of checking items for vulnerabilities that can be exploited,
   e.g. an outdate version of a webserver.
#. Gaining access / exploitation: using vulnerabilities found in step 2 to gain
   access to a network or website.
#. Maintaining access: Once we have access, the process of scanning and
   enumeration starts again so that we still have access after the computer is
   switched off temporarily, etc.
#. Covering tracks: delete logs that may contain information about us, delete
   any malware, and generally cleaning up.

Steps 1-3 will be the focus of the "Practical Ethical Hacking" course. This
process and methodology never changes, only the tools and attack methods may
change.
