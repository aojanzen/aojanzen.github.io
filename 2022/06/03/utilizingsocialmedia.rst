Utilizing Social Media
======================
Websites liked ``Linkedin`` or ``Twitter`` can deliver valuable information,
too, e.g. badge photos or desk photos.

``Linkedin`` profiles also give an easy way of finding employee names, figure
out current email addresses (e.g. in combination with the email address
structure found with the help of ``hunter.io``) or photos. There are tools
available to scrape this kind of information automatically, e.g. using Python.

People are always the weakest link when it somes to security, e.g. because they
are lazy and use simple passwords or because they post information that they
should not be posting.

As a pentester, we should use a "peeping account" rather than an account in our
real name so that we do not leave any clues as to who is looking into their
profiles and why.

Information gathering with Google and Linkedin and thorough enumeration of
vulnerabilities are the keys to successful penetration testing! We are mainly
after breached credentials in this phase!
